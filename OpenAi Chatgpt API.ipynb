            "    *   **How it works:** The CPU consists of billions of tiny transistors that act as on/off switches. By rapidly switching these on and off, it can perform complex arithmetic and logical operations at incredibly high speeds (billions per second).\n",

            "3.  **Storage (Hard Drive / SSD) - The Library / Long-Term Memory:**\n",

            "    *   **How it works:**\n",

            "7.  **Processing and Internet Request:** The CPU processes these keystrokes, and the browser application (still in RAM) constructs a request to fetch the webpage data from the internet. This data travels through network components (also connected to the motherboard).\n",
            "8.  **Displaying the Page (Output):** Once the data for the webpage arrives, the CPU processes it, and the graphics card displays the webpage content on your monitor.\n",
